## GitHub Documents

needed shortcuts for vscode : press Ctrl+Shift+V in the editor. You can view the preview side-by-side (Ctrl+K V) 


## Including Code

You can include R code in the document as follows:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
